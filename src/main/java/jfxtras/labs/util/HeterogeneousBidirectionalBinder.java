/**
 * A bidirectional object binding between two properties of different types.
 * It is a bindER rather than bindING for two reasons:
 * <ul>
 *     <li> We can't extend the original BidirectionalBinding since it has a private constructor </li>
 *     <li> It doesn't use static methods and it's a simple object you want to keep a reference around </li>
 * </ul>
 * The bind is effective from the constructor until unbind() is called. It is registered as a weaklistener to both properties.
 * <p>
 * Much like the oiginal BidirectionalBinding using StringConverter, you can have multiple bidirectional binders active at the same time.
 * Because they are glorified listeners multiple binders are activated in order of creation.
 * Still, avoid multiple active binders as the transformations of variables concatenate in usually strange fashion.
